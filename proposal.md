Characterizing a protein family in an evolutionary aspect could give hints about function, evolutionary history, critical residues and domains of this protein family.  In order to observe a protein’s functionality across animals which live in aquatic and terrestrial environments and also animals like tetrapods who live in intersection of this environments,  we chose the protein family **Carbamoyl-phosphate synthase,large subunit (CPS)**.

In  general,  animals  who  live  in  different  environments  have  different  excretory  systems. However, animals who live in the same environment and who are different kind of species can also have different excretory system. By examining the protein family which is one of the families that differ within different excretory systems, we are aiming to find evolutionary history of this protein family and it’s effect on the phenotypes of different species.  

Ammonia  is  poisonous  to  all  vertebrate,  although  it  is  not  dangerous  in  low  density  and  a  goodsolvent in water. Therefore,it is possible to excrete ammonia for animals who live in abundance of water called aquatic animals. In contrary, there is no such feasibility for terrestrial animals so that they have to convert ammonia into urea or uric acid in their livers by reacting ammonia with *CO<sub>2</sub>* via the ureacycle and excrete urea with consuming more energy due to this process.  

As mentioned before, species and their excretory systems are intervening in terms of environments.Whales who are mammals excrete urea in contrary to marine fishes. But some fishes which live in very alkaline environments excrete urea in contrary to marine fishes. Also there is a case of animals like amphibians,  which  live  in  both  of  these  two  environments,  demonstrates all three  of  these  nitrogen  wasteforms.  Because of this variety, we want to investigate the evolutionary history of the protein family of **CPS** that has a significant role in this process.
